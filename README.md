# AI-Face-Mask-Detector
This is a image processing project developed as a requirement for the completion of Concordia University's COMP 6721 Applied Artificial Intelligence Course. The overall goal is to develop  an AI that can analyze face images and detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not, as well as the type of mask that is being worn. The categories are - Person without a face mask, Person with a “community” (cloth) face mask, Person with a “surgical” (procedural) mask, Person with a “FFP2/N95/KN95”-type mask , and Person with a FFP2/N95/KN95 mask that has a valve.
